Advanced Internet Technologies and Web Programming Project - Ethan Cooke

Note on the location of quote of the day: I moved it to the home page content instead of the nav bar since it did not fit well 
into the layout I decided on for the navbar.

Submission 1 todo: 

Are there sufficient appropriate links in the dropdowns under the menu bar items? 
Do all inactive links have the "inactive popup" and go to a "sorry page"? 
Do active links go to pages with appropriate content and the same header and footer? 
Is there an appropriate "e-store Options" page? [Think of this a "future proofing" prep for e-store implementation.]
Are business specific links and pages OK? 
Do all pages exhibit the same "look and feel", and behave "responsively"? 
Do all pages validate against HTML5 and CSS3? 
Are all files well formatted? 
Are all web pages free of spelling and grammatical errors? 
Did readme.txt adequately describe state of the website?
